                  HBS Management (“NELOVOICE,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) provides a natural language processing platform that allows consumers to interact with our customers via an AI-based phone service. These services include any new features and applications, our mobile application(s) related to such services, and our website located at https://www.nelovoice.com (the “Site”), collectively referred to as the “Service(s)”. By registering for or creating a NELOVOICE account, or accessing, browsing, or otherwise using the Site, Mobile Apps, or any other aspect of the Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you are registering for an account or using the Service on behalf of an entity or other organization, you are agreeing to these Terms of Service for that entity or organization and representing to NELOVOICE that you have the authority to bind that entity or organization to these Terms of Service (and, in which case, the terms “you” and “your” will refer to that entity or organization). If you do not accept the terms and conditions of these Terms of Service, you will not access, browse, or otherwise use the Service.

                  NELOVOICE may change these Terms of Service from time to time by providing thirty (30) days' prior notice either by emailing the email address associated with your account or by posting a notice on the Site. The revised terms and conditions will become effective upon the later of any renewal of your subscription (if applicable) or thirty (30) days after we post or send you notice of such changes, and if you use the Service after that date, your use will constitute acceptance of the revised terms and conditions. If any change to these Terms of Service is not acceptable to you, your only remedy is to stop using the Services and send a cancellation email to contact@nelovoice.com.
